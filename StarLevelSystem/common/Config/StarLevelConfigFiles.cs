# Star Level System Expanded - Level Settings
#
# Controls how creature levels roll and how stats scale with them: the base
# levelup chances, per-biome and per-creature overrides, night settings,
# distance-from-center bonuses, and reusable level generators.
#
# This file is SERVER AUTHORITATIVE: the server's copy is synced to every
# client, so edit it on the server (or hosting player). Edits apply live.
# Levels vs stars: level 1 has no stars, level 2 = 1 star, level 3 = 2 stars.
# The MaxLevel / MaxBossLevel settings in the main .cfg cap everything here.
#
# --- Levelup chances ---
# Every chance table is 'level: chance', the percent chance for a creature to
# reach that level. Values must DECREASE as the level rises. A calculator for
# building spreads lives at https://sls-levelspreadtool.netlify.app/
#
#   DefaultCreatureLevelUpChance:
#     1: 20
#     2: 10
#     3: 5
#
# --- BiomeConfiguration ---
# Per-biome overrides. The special 'All' biome is the baseline for every biome;
# a specific biome's values win where they are set. Example:
#
#   BiomeConfiguration:
#     All:
#       SpawnRateModifier: 1.1          # 1.0 = no change, 2.0 = 2x spawns
#       DistanceScaleModifier: 1.5      # how strongly distance bonuses apply here
#       DamageReceivedModifiers:        # make everything weak to poison
#         Poison: 1.5
#       NightSettings:
#         NightLevelUpChanceScaler: 1.5 # higher levels more likely at night
#     Meadows:
#       BiomeMaxLevelOverride: 4        # hard level cap inside this biome
#       CreatureSpawnsDisabled: [ Troll ]
#
# --- CreatureConfiguration ---
# Per-prefab overrides; these beat the biome values for that creature. Prefab
# names must match exactly (find them with VNEI or the Jotunn docs).
#
#   CreatureConfiguration:
#     Troll:
#       CreatureMaxLevelOverride: 11
#       CustomCreatureLevelUpChance: { 1: 100, 2: 50, 3: 5 }
#       CreatureBaseValueModifiers:     # 1.0 = vanilla for base values
#         BaseHealth: 1.05
#       CreaturePerLevelValueModifiers: # added per level above 1 (0.05 = +5%/level)
#         SizePerLevel: 0.05
#       RequiredModifiers: { Fire: Major }
#
# --- DistanceLevelBonus ---
# Extra levelup chance by distance (metres) from the world center or starter
# temple (see DistanceBonusIsFromStarterTemple in the main .cfg). Each band's
# table is ADDED to the base chances once a spawn is past that distance;
# EnableDistanceLevelBonus turns the whole system on/off.
#
#   DistanceLevelBonus:
#     1250: { 1: 25, 2: 15 }
#     5000: { 1: 45, 2: 25, 3: 10 }
#
# --- Level generators ---
# Instead of hand-writing chance tables, generators expand a Min/Max level plus
# a curve style (Linear, Exponential, Gaussian, Table) into a table at load.
# Name them in CustomLevelupGenerators, then reference them anywhere a
# LevelupGeneratorRefs list exists (defaults, biomes, creatures, raids,
# nemesis spawns). When present, the generated curve REPLACES that section's
# chance table.
#
#   CustomLevelupGenerators:
#     late_game:
#     - MinLevel: 1
#       MaxLevel: 25
#       LevelUpChance: 0.35             # authored as a 0-1 fraction
#       LevelupCalculationStyle: Gaussian
#       GaussianOffset: 0.25
#   DefaultLevelupGeneratorRefs: [ late_game ]
#
# --- Table calculation style ---
# Linear/Exponential/Gaussian compute a curve from LevelUpChance; Table instead
# looks up a hand-authored shape from LevelupWeightTablesBySpan and shifts it
# onto the generator's own MinLevel..MaxLevel range. LevelUpChance and
# GaussianOffset are ignored for Table style.
#
# LevelupWeightTablesBySpan is keyed by SPAN (MaxLevel - MinLevel + 1), not by
# absolute level: each table's first entry always lands on the generator's own
# MinLevel, its second entry on MinLevel + 1, and so on. This lets many
# generators with different MinLevel/MaxLevel ranges (e.g. one per biome, each
# shifted further out) share one authored shape as long as their span matches -
# exactly what a ConditionalCreatureLevelupChance progression typically needs.
# If a generator's span has no matching entry here - or the entry is shorter
# than the span - it falls back to the Exponential curve and logs what to add,
# so keep an entry for every span you actually use. Thresholds must descend;
# an entry that rises is clamped so it does, with a warning naming the level.
#
#   LevelupWeightTablesBySpan:
#     4: { 1: 30, 2: 15,   3: 5,      4: 0.01 }
#     5: { 1: 30, 2: 16,   3: 6.8333, 4: 2.5,  5: 0.01 }
#     6: { 1: 30, 2: 17.5, 3: 8.5,    4: 3.0,  5: 1.0, 6: 0.01 }
#
#   CustomLevelupGenerators:
#     late_game:
#     - MinLevel: 3            # span = 3..8 = 6, so this uses the '6' table
#       MaxLevel: 8            # above: level 3 gets 30, level 4 gets 17.5, etc.
#       LevelupCalculationStyle: Table
#
# ConditionalCreatureLevelupChance switches biome curves as world bosses fall:
# defeated-boss global key -> biome -> generator. The FIRST entry whose key the
# world has set applies, so author them highest tier first. 'All' inside an
# entry is that entry's fallback biome, and the generator replaces that biome's
# Min/Max level bounds as well as its curve - so a conditional tier can raise
# creatures above the biome's own BiomeMaxLevelOverride.

#
# --- CharacterColorGenerators ---
# Builds a per-star ramp automatically by blending between two colors across a

#       RangeEnd: 15

#       CharacterSpecific: true     # write into this creature's own table
#       OverwriteExisting: false    # keep any hand-written entries in the range

# is, how strong it is, and which creatures/biomes it is allowed on. Server
# authoritative; edits apply live.
#
# Modifiers come in three pools: MajorModifiers, MinorModifiers and
# BossModifiers. How MANY a creature rolls (and the chance per slot) comes from
# the main .cfg (MaxMajorModifiers etc.) and can be overridden per creature in
# LevelSettings.yaml. This file configures the modifiers themselves.
#
# IMPORTANT: a NON-EMPTY pool section REPLACES the built-in list for that pool.
# If you write a MajorModifiers section, list every major you want active - a
# modifier you leave out stops rolling. An absent section keeps the defaults.
# Valid modifier names are exactly the keys in the generated default sections
# (Brutal, Fast, Big, Alert, Fire, Frost, Poison, Lightning, ElementalChaos,
# StaminaDrain, EitrDrain, Resist*, SoulEater, LifeLink, Splitter, Lootbags,
# FireNova, PoisonNova, Evolving, BossSummoner, ...). New modifiers can only be
# added through the mod API, not from yaml.

# Star Level System Expanded - Nemesis Settings
#
# The Nemesis system reacts to how each player is doing: a hidden per-player
# score rises as they fight well and falls when they die, and score-gated
# events (stronger spawns, ambushes, minibosses) trigger against players who
# are doing too well. Needs EnableNemesisSystem in the main .cfg. Server
# authoritative; edits apply live.
#
# DO NOT edit NemesisVersion. A version this build can migrate is migrated in
# place; one it cannot is refused, and the server keeps running on the last
# values that loaded cleanly. The file itself is left exactly as you wrote it.
#
# NOTE: AvailableMiniBosses is written by the SERVER at runtime - minibosses
# created from player killers are added and spawned ones are removed, and the
# file is rewritten each time. Treat that section as state, not hand-config.

        private const string LocationResetHeader = @"#################################################
# Star Level System Expanded - Location Reset Settings
#
# Resets overworld locations, dungeons, vegetation, ores and pickables so they can be
# looted again. Sweeps run server-side, in the background, only in zones with no players
# nearby. Timers are in real-world hours. NOTHING resets until both the EnableLocationReset
# BepInEx setting and the Enabled flag below are turned on.
#
# --- Reset groups: start here ---
# ResetGroups is where the work happens. A group both ENABLES a set of targets and gives them
# their settings, in one block:
#
#   ResetGroups:
#     Ores:
#       Enabled: true
#       ResetHours: 48
#       ResetTerrain: true
#       Members: [rock4_copper, MineRock_Tin, silvervein, rock3_silver, mudpile_beacon]
#
# Groups stand on their own - a member needs no entry anywhere else in this file. To turn a whole
# category off, set its Enabled: false; to drop one target, remove it from Members. If two groups
# claim the same prefab the shorter interval wins and the other is named in a warning. A member
# name this world has nothing for is warned about at load, never fatal.
#
# A member can also be a category token, $Mineable or $Pickable, which expands to everything this
# world PLACES carrying that component, and so covers modded content too. Unlike a named member a
# token stops there: one-off pickups that only exist inside dungeons are not swept up by it, so
# name those explicitly if you want them. Berry bushes are NOT Pickable_* prefabs, which is why
# they are listed separately below.
#
# MinDistance / MaxDistance limit a group to a ring around spawn (MaxDistance 0 = no outer limit).
# A scoped group applies only inside its range; outside it, its members fall back to whatever
# unscoped group covers them.
#
# --- Locations and Vegetation: overrides only ---
# Both ship EMPTY and can usually stay that way. Add a key only to override one target, or to
# enable something no group covers. Values resolve entry -> group -> Defaults, so a per-prefab
# setting always beats its group:
#
#   Locations:
#     Eikthyrnir:
#       ResetHours: 12      # BossAltars still enables it; this just retimes it
#
# For the full list of names this world can reset - including everything other mods add - run
# the console command sls-loc-dump. It writes SavedData/LocationResetCatalog.yaml as a
# reference; that file is a dump, not a config, and editing it does nothing.
#
# --- Scheduling: ResetHours or ResetSchedule ---
# ResetHours is elapsed time since a target last reset, so a 24h timer drifts a little later
# every cycle. ResetSchedule is a cron expression instead, for a fixed time of day:
#
#   ResetGroups:
#     Ores:
#       ResetSchedule: 0 3 * * *      # 03:00 every day
#     Foraging:
#       ResetSchedule: '*/30 * * * *' # every 30 minutes (quote anything starting with *)
#
# Fields are: minute hour day-of-month month day-of-week, with * , - and */n. Day-of-week is
# 0-6 (0 = Sunday) or SUN-SAT; months are 1-12 or JAN-DEC. The macros @hourly, @daily,
# @midnight, @weekly, @monthly and @yearly also work.
#
# Times are the SERVER'S LOCAL TIME, not UTC or in-game time. On the day the clocks go
# forward, a schedule inside the skipped hour runs as soon as the hour ends; on the day they
# go back it still runs once.
#
# Two gotchas worth knowing:
#   - If BOTH day-of-month and day-of-week are restricted, a day matching EITHER one fires.
#     0 0 1 * MON is the 1st of the month AND every Monday, not only Mondays that land on the
#     1st. Every cron behaves this way.
#   - BiomeRates and DistanceBands do NOT scale a cron schedule - there is no sensible way to
#     halve 'every Tuesday at 3am'. A rate of 0 still excludes the chunk entirely.
#
# ResetHours and ResetSchedule resolve as one unit, entry -> group -> Defaults: the first
# level that sets either one owns the timing, so a per-prefab ResetHours still overrides its
# group's ResetSchedule. Where a single level sets both, the schedule wins and it is logged.
# An invalid expression is logged and that target falls back to ResetHours.
#
# --- Targeting resets: BiomeRates and DistanceBands ---
# Both are multipliers applied on top of each entry's own ResetHours, so 1.0 changes
# nothing and they stack:  effective hours = ResetHours x biome rate x band rate.
# Use them to focus resets on the areas players actually strip.
#
#   BiomeRates:
#     Meadows: 0.5        # everything in the Meadows returns twice as fast
#     Mistlands: 2.0      # ...and half as fast out in the Mistlands
#   DistanceBands:
#   - Inner: 0            # metres from spawn (or from world centre - see
#     Outer: 3000         # DistanceBonusIsFromStarterTemple in the BepInEx config)
#     Multiplier: 0.5     # the hub recovers twice as fast
#
# A rate of 0 EXCLUDES that biome or band from resets entirely - it does not mean
# 'instantly'. Outer: 0 means the band has no outer limit. A chunk matching no band is
# left at 1.0, so a partial band list never disables the rest of the world.
#
# --- Protection: the three actions ---
# Every Protection category takes one of three actions:
#
#   Block     the whole chunk is left alone while the object is there. The safest, and the
#             default for everything except dropped items
#   Preserve  the object is kept, and the reset goes ahead around it
#   Ignore    the object is ordinary resettable content and IS DELETED
#
# DroppedItem ships as Preserve, so loot a player left on the ground survives a reset without
# holding the chunk back. If you ever see items piling up inside a location, set it to Ignore
# and they will be cleared with everything else.
#
# --- Ignored prefabs ---
# Each category can also list individual prefabs exempt from it. An ignored prefab neither
# blocks a chunk from resetting nor survives one - IT IS DELETED. fire_pit ships ignored
# because one abandoned campfire otherwise freezes a chunk (and its 8 neighbours) forever,
# and a campfire sitting on an ore spawn stops that ore ever coming back.
#
# The exemption only reaches objects that are IN that category to begin with. Every player
# category is detected by the creator stamped on the object, so ignoring wood_floor drops the
# protection from decking a PLAYER left behind and does nothing to the identical wood_floor
# that world generation put in a house - that one was never protected as player property, and
# is restored or left alone by its location's own rules.
#
#   Protection:
#     PlayerBuiltPiece:
#       Action: Block
#       Ignored:
#       - fire_pit
#
# Tombstones can never be ignored, and anything in ProtectedPrefabs wins over an ignore.
# Tamed creatures are never deleted, whatever the categories or ignore lists say.
#
# --- Per-group and per-entry Protection: scoped ignores ---
# Protection can be set at three levels: Defaults (everywhere), a reset group (chunks
# holding that group's content), and a single Locations/Vegetation entry (chunks holding
# that one target). Rules resolve entry -> group -> Defaults per CATEGORY, and an override
# replaces the whole rule for that category - Action AND Ignored list together. A group
# that writes its own PlayerBuiltPiece rule therefore no longer inherits the fire_pit
# ignore from Defaults in its chunks; re-list it if you still want it.
#
# An override applies to every protection decision for the chunks it governs: whether the
# chunk is blocked from resetting at all, and what survives the reset when it runs. This is
# how you stop player litter freezing a resource group without loosening protection
# anywhere else. Both rule forms work here, same as in Defaults - a bare action, or a
# mapping with an Ignored list:
#
#   ResetGroups:
#     Ores:
#       ResetHours: 48
#       Members: [rock4_copper, MineRock_Tin]
#       Protection:
#         PlayerBuiltPiece: Ignore        # player builds neither block ore chunks nor
#                                         #   survive their reset - they are DELETED by it
#         Container:
#           Action: Block                 # chests still block ore chunks...
#           Ignored: [piece_chest_wood]   # ...except plain wood chests, which are deleted
#
#   Locations:
#     TrollCave02:
#       Protection:
#         PlayerBuiltPiece: Ignore        # scoped to chunks holding this one location
#
# Which chunks a group governs is decided by CONTENT, not distance: a chunk is governed by
# the location recorded in it plus every configured vegetation prefab the sweep has seen
# there. A blocking object standing in a neighbouring chunk (within ProtectionRadius) is
# judged by the rules of the chunk being reset, and a chunk holding nothing configured is
# always judged by Defaults alone.
#
# Where the content of two groups shares a chunk, the stricter rule wins per object: an
# ignore takes effect only when every governing target agrees, so relaxing the Ores group
# can never expose a crypt that happens to share the chunk. A disabled target gets no vote.
# And remember that only pieces a player actually BUILT block in the first place -
# world-generated furniture never does - so these ignores exist for genuine player litter,
# like the workbench abandoned on an ore spawn.
#
# Two categories never take a group or entry override: Ward (a player's explicit claim on
# an area) and Tombstone (their dropped gear). Defaults alone govern those two, and an
# override for either is dropped with a warning at load. ProtectedPrefabs also still wins
# over every ignore, at every level.
#
# --- ProtectionRadius ---
# How far from a chunk's centre a player build still protects that chunk, in metres.
# Default 48. The scan always reads a chunk and its 8 neighbours, so 96 means the whole 3x3
# block protects, and is the most it can ever see; values are clamped to 32-96.
#
# Lower it if too little is resetting: at the full 96m one forgotten chest protects nine
# chunks, which is the usual reason a server's crypts never come back. Raise it if players
# report builds near a chunk edge being cleared.
#
#   Defaults:
#     ProtectionRadius: 48
#
# --- ExtraTerrainRadius ---
# Per location: metres of terrain reset BEYOND the location's own radius, for the ramps and
# moats players dig around the outside. Clamped to ProtectionRadius minus 32m (so 32m at the
# default), which is as far past a location's own footprint as the protection scan actually
# checked for player property - resetting terrain further would flatten ground nobody looked
# at. Raising ProtectionRadius raises this ceiling with it.
#
# --- Advanced sections, omitted while unused ---
# These four are left out of the generated file because their defaults are right for almost
# every server. Add the section by hand to use one; anything you leave out keeps its default.
#
#   ProtectedPrefabs: [portal_wood]   # always block a reset, whatever category detection says
#
#   DistanceBands: []                 # see the section above
#
#   InPlaceRefresh:                   # tier 1: refresh ZDO state without loading the zone
#     Pickables: true                 # regrow picked berries, mushrooms, flint
#     MineRocks: true                 # restore mined ore deposits
#     ContainerDefaultLoot: false     # re-roll chest loot. OFF: the one refresh that grants items
#
#   Throughput:                       # sweep pacing. Retune only if the server is struggling
#     SweepBudgetMillisecondsPerFrame: 4    # primary throttle (LocationResetSweepBudgetMs wins)
#     MaxZonesPerSecondFastLane: 200        # ZDO-only refreshes
#     MaxZonesPerSecondSlowLane: 2          # resets that must load the zone
#     AdaptiveBackoffFrameMs: 50            # over this frame time, halve the budget next tick
#     ZdoGrowthTolerance: 0                 # ZDOs a reset may leak before it is reported in the log
#
# --- Targets registered by other mods ---
# Mods can register their own reset targets through the Star Level System API - a mod that adds
# a custom dungeon can ask for it to be reset on a schedule. Those registrations never appear
# in this file, and are not written to it. Run 'sls-loc-api' to list them: it shows the target,
# which mod registered it, its schedule, and whether this file is overriding it.
#
# You always have the last word. Adding a Locations: or Vegetation: key for the same prefab
# name takes manual control of that target and replaces the mod's registration outright - which
# is how you turn one off, since you cannot edit another mod's registration the way you would
# edit a group's member list. Protection rules are yours alone and cannot be set from the API.
#
# Mods can also ask for a reset, or register a target, from a CLIENT - so that an item which
# renews a dungeon works for the player who used it. Those requests are not admin-gated, so the
# server bounds them instead, with three settings in the BepInEx config (LocationReset section):
# ClientLocationResetMaxRadius clamps how large an area one request may cover,
# ClientLocationResetMaxDistance stops a client asking about ground it is not near, and
# ClientLocationResetCooldownSeconds limits how often any one client may ask. Set the cooldown
# very high to effectively switch client requests off. Player structures are protected from
# every route regardless.
