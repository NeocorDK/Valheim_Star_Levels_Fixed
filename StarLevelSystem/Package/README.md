## Features

### Levels, Levels and more Levels (LevelSettings.yaml)
So you want creatures to have more levels, but you don't want to die instantly to a level 100 boar when you start the game? 
Well have I got the config file for you.

Level settings allows configuration of creature levelup chance, creature stats, max level, increased level up chance based on
distance from the center- and respectively biome based configs for all of that.

#### Biome Configuration
Lets take a look at some of the things you can do with this, and what better spot to start out than the default `All` biome
configuration (which applies to every creature by default).

Here is a section of the default example config, lets walk through what everything does.
```
 All:
    distanceScaleModifier: 1.5       # The influence of distance ring based scale increases (1.5 means 150% of the bonus value will be applied)
    spawnRateModifier: 1.1           # Spawn rate of every creature is 10% higher (1.1), which means every spawn has a 10% chance of being 2 creatures.
    creatureBaseValueModifiers:      # These values modify the base stats of every creature in this biome (eg, all creatures)
      BaseHealth: 1                  # The default health of all creatures is 100% (1), numbers below 1 reduce health, above increase is (2) is 200% health for everything
      BaseDamage: 1                  # Default damage of all creatures is 100% (1)
      Speed: 1                       # Default movement speed of all creatures is 100% (1)
      Size: 1                        # Default size of all creatures is 100% (1)
    creaturePerLevelValueModifiers:  # Per level modifiers are applied per level, eg each star will give this value to the creature
      HealthPerLevel: 0.4            # Each star provides 40% more health (0.4)
      DamagePerLevel: 0.1            # Each star provides 10% more damage (0.1)
      SpeedPerLevel: 0               # Each star does not increase speed (0)
      SizePerLevel: 0.1              # Each star makes the creature 10% bigger (0.1). Negative values shrink instead (-0.1 is 10% smaller per star)
    damageReceivedModifiers:         # Damage reduction or increases
      Poison: 1.5                    # Everything recieves 50% (1.5) more damage from poison (that includes players)
```
Note: `creaturePerLevelValueModifiers` do not apply to characters. But, `damageReceivedModifiers` DOES.

The `creatureBaseValueModifiers` and `creaturePerLevelValueModifiers` blocks above are shown to explain
the shape - the shipped `All` biome does not set either of them, and creatures fall back to the values in
the main .cfg until you add them. Keys are written in PascalCase when the file is generated
(`SpawnRateModifier`, `DamageReceivedModifiers`); reading is case-insensitive, so either spelling works.
`damageRecievedModifiers` is the old misspelling and is still read, but never written back.

Note on sizing: per-level size is applied as `Size + (SizePerLevel * stars)`, so a 0 star creature is
exactly `Size`. `SizePerLevel` may be negative to make creatures shrink with each star. The final
multiplier is floored at the `MinimumCreatureScale` config value (default `0.1`), so creatures can never
reach zero size or turn inside-out no matter how negative the value is.

Biome specific configurations can be used to override the default `All` configuration, in this case max level for Ashlands is being set
to 26 and the distance modifier is being reduced by 50%
```
  AshLands:
    biomeMaxLevelOverride: 26
    distanceScaleModifier: 0.5
```

#### Creature Configuration
Creature specific configuration allows you to override what is set in the biome definition for a creature, which allows more
fine-grained control of how a specific creature should be modified.

Lets take a look at this creature definition
```
  Troll:                                # Creature prefab name, must match exactly, you can find this using VNEI, the wiki, or Jotunn prefab documentation
    customCreatureLevelUpChance:        # Sets the levelup chance for this specific creature, overrides the default values, can still be modified by distance bonuses
      1: 100                            # Threshold to STAY at level 1 - a roll of 0-100 practically never clears 100, so level 1 is skipped
      2: 50                             # 50% chance to reach level 2
      3: 5                              # 5% chance to reach level 3
    creatureMaxLevelOverride: 11        # Overrides the max level for this creature (11 instead of biome default)
    creatureBaseValueModifiers:         # Overrides the base stat modifiers for this creature, values below 1 reduce stats, above 1 increase stats
      BaseHealth: 1.05                  # Base health is increased by 5%
      BaseDamage: 0.95                  # Base damage is reduced by 5%
      Speed: 1.05                       # Speed is increased by 5%
      Size: 1.05                        # Size is increased by 5%
      AttackSpeed: 1.05                 # Attack speed is increased by 5%
    creaturePerLevelValueModifiers:     # Per level stat modifiers for this creature, these are multiplied by the creatures level and applied to the total stat value
      HealthPerLevel: 0.3               # Each star provides 30% more health
      DamagePerLevel: 0.05              # Each star provides 5% more damage
      SizePerLevel: 0.005               # Each star provides 0.5% more size (use a negative value to shrink per star)
    requiredModifiers:                  # Modifiers that this creature will always spawn with, regardless of level, chance or modifier limit, but still count towards max modifier count
      Poison: Major                     # Trolls will always spawn with the Poison major modifier, Modifier names can be found in Modifiers.yaml, along with their categories
```

#### Levelup Chance
This is a definition of the chance that a creature has to level up at each point.

This works hand in hand with the distance scale modifier and `distanceLevelBonus`, distance level bonuses are applied if
the creature falls into a distance category with bonuses.
eg: 
```
distanceLevelBonus:
  1250:
    1: 25
```
Will give all creatures a +25% chance to reach the first star level, if they are at least 1250m from the center. This value is then modified based on biome settings.
In our example biome file we have a `1.5` value for the distance modifier so `1.5 x 25 = 37.5` would be the increase provided to reach level 1.

If the total bonus and base value exceeds `100` that level will be guaranteed, every creature with that condition will be at a minimum that level.
You can see this in some of the later distance bonuses which slowly drive of the guaranteed spawn level of creatures up

```
  5000:
    1: 100      
    2: 100      # All creatures at least 5000m from center will be level 2+
    3: 75
    4: 50
    5: 25
    6: 15
```

You can also use the distanceLevelBonus to add additional levels, make it so that certain distances are required to spawn higher level enemies.

```
defaultCreatureLevelUpChance:
  1: 20
  2: 15
distanceLevelBonus:
  1250:
    1: 25
    2: 15
    3: 5
  5000:
    1: 100      
    2: 100
    3: 75
    4: 50
```

With the above configuration the region closest to start up to 1250m will only be able to spawn level 1 and 2 creatures. Between 1250m and 5000m creatures can spawn up to level 3, and beyond 5000m creatures can spawn up to level 4.


Now, we've walked through a lot of the bonuses to level up chance but lets take a look at the base values too. 
Star level systems default config has a relatively large spawn range- which is limited by biome configuration.

`defaultCreatureLevelUpChance` Defines the levelup chance of all creatures, this however can be limited by biome configuration and
it can be increased by other factors, such as the distance from center bonus.
```
defaultCreatureLevelUpChance:
  1: 20      # 20% of creatures go past level 1
  2: 10
  3: 5
  4: 2
  5: 1
  6: 0.5
  7: 0.25
  8: 0.125
  # ... halving down to 25: 0.0001 in the shipped defaults
```

Rather than writing this table by hand you can have it generated from a curve - see
`DefaultLevelupGenerators` and `LevelupCalculationStyle` in the header of `LevelSettings.yaml`, or turn
on "Use level generator" in the in-game config panel. A generator REPLACES this table on load, so the
two are alternatives, not layers.

### Nemesis System
The Nemesis system is designed to constantly tune the world around a player or group of players to ensure that their experience and challenges are appropriate.

It does this by analyzing things the player does and tracking statistics about the players combat performance. Lower combat scores result in reduced challenge,
high combat scores result in increased challenge.

This is all extremely configurable, and everyone's experience is likely to be very different due to differences in skill or playstyle and that is ok.
Ideally everyone should feel times of challenge, and that setbacks do not feel overwhelmingly punishing.

Nemesis system also contains the ability to make unique enemies that will attempt to hunt you (or a friend) down in the future (small chance to spawn).

Nemesis configuration.
```
NemesisVersion: 1
CreateMinibossFromPlayerKiller: true   # controls whether or not player deaths can result in a nemesis enemy being created
CreationRemovesSourceCreature: true    # whether or not the create that turns into a nemesis boss gets removed from its current location
NemesisBossChance: 0.1                 # chance that a nemesis boss can be created
NemesisBossMaxLevelBonus: 0.4          # percentage level bonus for the nemesis boss
NemesisBossMinLevelBonus: 0.2
NemesisMinionTemplatesByBiome: ...
ScoreSystem:                           # Nemesis score system determines player score and what actions can happen
  NeutralScore: 5000                   # score moves back towards this neutral point all of the time
  MaxScore: 10000                      # max score
  DeathScoreReduction: 1500            # how much score is reduced when the player dies
  DecayPerUpdate: 250                  # how much the score moves towards neutral constantly
  NearbyPlayerRadius: 60               # nearby radius for syncing score with friends
  MeleeDamageDealtFactor: 0.75         # score contribution of melee damage
  MagicDamageDealtFactor: 0.5          # score contribution for magic damage
  RangedDamageDealtFactor: 0.25        # score contribution for ranged damage
  DamageTakenFactor: -0.5              # score contriubtion for taking damage
  BossKillBonus: 500                   # score bonus from killing a boss
GaurenteedChanges:                     # nemesis changes that always happen
  FirstBossSetLevel: true              # first world boss of each kind when enabled will use the specified level
  FirstBossLevel: 1
```

There are a few additional sections to this config that are worth covering also. Chance changes being the primary one.

```
ChanceChanges:
  CreatureOps:                              # Chance changes are random actions the nemesis system can take
    CharredAttack:                          # name of the action, required unique
      RequiredGlobalKey: defeated_fader     # if the action requires the server has a certain global key
      Chance: 0.3                           # chance the action will happen (valid values 1 <-> 0)
      LevelBonus: 5                         # level bonus applied to spawns from this
      DeniedBiomes:                         # Biomes this is not allowed to happen in
      - DeepNorth
      AllowedBiomes: []                     # Biomes this is allowed to happen in, empty allows all
      ScoreThreshold: 9000                  # Score threshold, the players score must be at least at this level (if above neutral score) or below this level if threshold is below neutral score
      Action: Spawn                         # action, valid options: ChangeLevel, AddModifier, RemoveModifier, Spawn, SpawnMiniboss
      ScoreChange: -2000                    # point change applied to score when this event happens
      SpawnConfig:                          # Spawns associated with this config
      - Prefab: Charred_Melee               # spawn creature prefab
        SpawnGroupSize: 1                   # number of creatures to spawn
        Faction: Boss                       # faction to assign to the creature
        RequiredModifiers:                  # modifiers the creature must have
          Fire: Major
      - Prefab: Charred_Ranged
        SpawnGroupSize: 2
        Faction: Boss
        RequiredModifiers:
          Fire: Major
          ...
```

The final section in this config is NemesisMinionTemplatesByBiome. This controls the minions which can be added to a nemesis spawn.

```
NemesisMinionTemplatesByBiome:
  Meadows:
  - PrefabName: Neck
    MinAmount: 6
    MaxAmount: 9
    CreatureBaseValueModifiers:
      BaseHealth: 2
    CreaturePerLevelValueModifiers:
      DamagePerLevel: 0.01
```


### Colorization (Colorization.yaml)
In vanilla there are few creatures which can be colorized when they level up. Star Level Systems changes that. 
Most all creatures can be colorized, it should be noted that some creatures (Yagluth eg) do not colorize well and the effect is generally not very noticeable.

There are two different ways to apply colorization values to creatures.

- Creature specific color definitions. 
  These are split between default definitions (applied to any creature, if it does not have a more specific entry) 
  and character specific entries. These will be applied at the keyed level to the specified creature.
	```
	  Greydwarf:
		1:
		  hue: -0.06
		  saturation: 0.1
		  value: 0.05
	```
- Color Range definitions. These are ranges of color that will be sliced up and generate gradually changing color patterns 
  based on the ranges between the start and end points.
  ```
  DefaultGenerator:
  - characterSpecific: false
    startColorDef:
      hue: 0.07130837
      saturation: 0.05205864
      value: 0.01721987
    endColorDef:
      hue: -0.07488244
      saturation: 0.09342755
      value: -0.1008582
    rangeStart: 1
    rangeEnd: 15
  ```
  In this example, level ranges for default colors from level 1 to 15 will form a range of colors from hue 0.07130837 -> -0.07488244 etc.
  If you want to see the output from a generator you can enable the debug flag to dump the generated colorization config to a file. 
  You can use this to hand-pick color values etc.

### Loot Configuration
Star level systems provides full optional configuration to control in detail all loot drops. Loot configuration can be found in the `LootSettings.yaml` file.

You may find it useful to see what existing drops look like within the SLS system. 
You can do this by dumping a debug configuration of all loot drops (as they are) with the in-game console command `sls-dump-loottables`, this is output to the SLS config folder in the file `LootTablesDump.yaml`.

There are three core parts to configuring loot drops, but many options to modify if you wish to fine tune loot configurations.

- characterSpecificLoot | this governs all character based loot drops
- nonCharacterSpecificLoot | this controls all non-character based loot drops
- distanceLootModifier | this allows distance scaling of loot, similar to how distance level scaling works

#### Character Specific Loot configuration
Lets take a look at the character specific loot drop. Here is one of the example configurations, and it is here to address a specific challenge.
Oozers create blobs when they die, this scales with the level of the creature. However, when you have a very high level oozer you can end up with 20,30 or more blobs.
Which can be impossible to deal with. This deals with that in a few ways, the final `- drop:` entry is for the Blob, spawning a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 2. But scaling with
the level of the `BlobElite` (Oozer), however that scaling is capped at a maximum of 6 drops, and only scales `.5` per level. So every other level another blob can be spawned
up to a maximum of 6.

Another useful entry to look at here is the drop for `TrophyBlob`, this has a `0.1` (10%) chance of happening, but it scales x0.01 per level, so a level five is (0.01 x 5) = 0.05 (5%) higher chance of happening.
This can be combined with a drop count to scale the drops for the entry, so a level 5 could drop more trophies. But this is disabled by setting the `maxScaledAmount: 1`
```
characterSpecificLoot:
  BlobElite:
  - drop:
      prefab: Ooze
      min: 2
      max: 3
      levelMultiplier: true
    amountScaleFactor: 0.5
  - drop:
      prefab: IronScrap
      chance: 0.33
      levelMultiplier: true
    amountScaleFactor: 0.2
  - drop:
      prefab: TrophyBlob
      chance: 0.1
      levelMultiplier: true
    chanceScaleFactor: 0.01
    maxScaledAmount: 1
  - drop:
      prefab: Blob
      min: 2
      max: 2
      levelMultiplier: true
    amountScaleFactor: 0.5
    maxScaledAmount: 6
```

#### Non Character specific loot configuration

This is the section which allows you to configure all of the non-creature related loot in detail. It follows a similar structure to character loot configuration.
You can use this to modify or add loot to any existing objects which have the option to drop loot. For example, falling stalactites. This configuration gives them a chance to drop crystals.
The chance scales per level (yes inanimate objects can be leveled, tree, rock or destructible based on type). If loot configuration is not defined here then the generic configuration values from
the main config file apply here `PerLevelDestructibleLootScale`, `PerLevelMineRockLootScale`, and `PerLevelTreeLootScale` along with their max level values.
Level scaling can be ignored by setting `dontScale: true`

```
nonCharacterSpecificLoot:
  caverock_ice_stalagtite_falling:
  - drop:
      prefab: crystal
      chance: 0.3
      min: 1
      max: 3
      dontScale: true
  EvilHeart_Forest:
  - drop:
      prefab: AncientSeed
      onePerPlayer: true
      levelMultiplier: true
    maxScaledAmount: 3
```

#### Distance Loot Modifier
This is similar to the character distance modifier in that it applies a bonus to the minimum and maximum drops that an entry can have based on distance.
Loot rings are not drawn on the map, but behave exactly the same as Character distance rings (if the object is greater than x distance and less than the next once it receives that bonus).

```
distanceLootModifier:
  1250:
    minAmountScaleFactorBonus: 1.02
    maxAmountScaleFactorBonus: 1.02
```

### Raids
SLS supports significantly overhauled and configurable raids. These can be disabled if you wish to revert to vanilla style raids.

By default all raids are per-player, server controlled and concurrent raids are enabled. This means with SLS it is possible that every player on a server gets an appropriate raid
during an event.

The number of players, frequency, and most all details of each raid is configurable through `RaidSettings.yaml`.

Raid settings are **server authoritative**. On a dedicated or player hosted server the server's `UseVanillaRaidConfiguration` value and its `RaidSettings.yaml` are synced down to every client on join, so editing either of them on a client has no effect - change them on the server.

#### Raid cooldowns and logging out

Each player's raid cooldown, and the server's own raid check schedule, are saved per world and picked back up exactly where they left off when the world is loaded again. Logging out and back in does not hand anyone a fresh raid.

`RaidCooldownClock` chooses what a cooldown is actually measured against:

- `WorldTime` (default) - the world's own clock. It advances whenever anybody is playing the world, and jumps forward when someone sleeps through a night. On a busy server a player's cooldown keeps burning down while other people play without them.
- `PlayerTime` - each player's own time in the world. A cooldown only counts down while that player is actually online, so logging out with 20 minutes left brings them back with 20 minutes left however long they were away, and other people's sessions do not shorten it.

Neither clock runs while nobody is playing. Switching between them re-bases everyone's remaining cooldown, so nobody gains or loses raid time by the change.

Below is an example of many of the details that can be configured for a given raid
```
- Name: foresttrolls              # Each raid has its own name, these should be unique or can be incorrectly selected
  Duration: 180                   # Duration of the raid, in seconds
  RaidCoolDownMinutes: 120        # The number of minutes between when this raid triggers and the player becomes eligble for a new raid
  ForceEnvironment: Crypt         # Environment that will be set when the raid starts available options: Clear, Misty, Darklands_dark, DeepForest_Mist, Heath_clear, InfectedMine, GDKing, Rain, LightRain, ThunderStorm, Eikthyr, Fader,

### Modifiers
Maybe you've tried out CLLC's modifiers, or Monster Modifiers? Both really add variety to the game that is much needed.
Star Levels Systems modifiers are designed to be extremely flexible, both in configuration- but also in effect.

There are however a number of modifiers and it can be a bit unclear what each does. So to start off here is a table of all current modifiers and how they work.

Modifiers are split into three categories. `Boss`, `Major`, and `Minor`. Which allows customization into the random selection process for modifiers, 
along with separate tuning for modifiers that appear on bosses vs minor creatures.

#### Boss Modifiers
These modifiers are by default only available on bosses.

### Location Reset (LocationResetSettings.yaml)
> **Back up your world before enabling this.** Location Reset destroys and recreates world objects.

On a busy server the world is a finite pool of loot. Crypts, camps, ore and pickables get consumed
once and never come back, so late joiners and less-active players are permanently locked out of
content the early players already stripped. Location Reset brings that content back on a timer.

**It is disabled by default, and every location and vegetation entry is opt-in.** Turn on
`EnableLocationReset`, then set `Enabled: true` on the specific things you want to come back.

How it works:
- **Resets happen in the background, only in zones with no players nearby.** Nobody ever watches a
  location pop out and back in, which is what causes the lag spikes and item duplication other
  reset mods warn about. A chunk somebody happened to be standing in is re-tried a couple of times
  a few minutes later rather than losing its whole cycle.
- **Locations are restored, not re-rolled.** The original position and rotation are kept, so
  buildings never rotate, shift or clip into the terrain after a reset.
- **Ore, pickables and vegetation come back in exactly their original spots**, because placement is
  replayed using the world's own generation seed. Replaying it re-places every node in the chunk, so
  the ones still standing are matched by position and discarded rather than stacked on top of the
  survivor — `sls-loc-audit` will tell you if any ever slip through.
- **Dungeon interiors reset with their entrance** — crypts, caves, mines and citadels.
- **Terrain can be reset** around ore to undo mining craters. Locations also support
  `Mode: TerrainOnly`, which flattens the ground around one without touching the structure itself.
- **Your stuff is safe.** Player-built structures, tombstones, wards, portals, beds, player-placed
  chests and tamed creatures all block a reset. Protection is configurable per entry, so you can
  decide (for example) that a stray dropped item is preserved rather than blocking the whole zone.
- `StartTemple` can never be reset. Boss altars are covered by the `BossAltars` group, which ships
  enabled with terrain reset on to undo the crater players dig around a summoning circle — set
  `Enabled: false` on that group to leave them alone.

Timers are in **real-world hours** (`ResetHours`), which stays predictable on a server that runs
24/7. Throughput is controlled by `LocationResetSweepBudgetMs` — the milliseconds of server frame
time the sweep may use per frame. Raise it to restore the world faster; it automatically backs off
when the server is under load. Use `sls-loc-status` to see the projected time for a full pass.

After installing on an already-explored world, run `sls-loc-stamp` once so every zone's
timer starts from today instead of everything becoming due at once.

**Reset groups.** Groups are how this feature is configured. A group configures and **enables** a
whole set of targets in one block, and stands on its own — a member needs no entry anywhere else in
the file:

```yaml
ResetGroups:
  Ores:
    Enabled: true
    ResetHours: 48
    ResetTerrain: true
    Members: [rock4_copper, MineRock_Tin, silvervein, rock3_silver, mudpile_beacon]
```

To turn a whole category off, set its `Enabled: false`; to drop one target, remove it from
`Members`. If two groups claim the same prefab the shorter interval wins and the other is named in a
warning, and a member name your game version has nothing for is warned about at load.

A member can also be a category token — `$Mineable` or `$Pickable` — which expands to everything the
world *places* carrying that component, and so picks up modded ore and pickables automatically.
Unlike a named member a token stops there: one-off pickups that only exist inside dungeons are not
swept up by it, so name those explicitly if you want them. Note that berry bushes are *not*
`Pickable_*` prefabs, which is why the shipped config lists them separately. Prefab names are
irregular enough that this matters: copper is `rock4_copper` while `rock4_forest` is worthless
scenery, and silver is both `rock3_silver` and `silvervein`.

A group can be limited to a ring around spawn with `MinDistance` / `MaxDistance` (`MaxDistance: 0`
means no outer limit). A scoped group applies only inside its range; outside it, its members fall
back to whatever unscoped group covers them — so `FlintNearSpawn` at 6h within 3000m leaves flint on
the normal foraging timer everywhere else.

The mod ships working groups (`BossAltars`, `Ores`, `Berries`, `Foraging`, `FlintNearSpawn`,
`Leviathans`, `QuestSites`, `CharredSpawners`, `AshlandsForts`) **already enabled**, so the feature
is usable without editing anything. Nothing resets until `EnableLocationReset` and the YAML
`Enabled` are both turned on. `sls-loc-status` lists every group with a `matched/total` member
count — a shortfall means a prefab name no longer exists in your game version.

**Locations and Vegetation are overrides.** Both ship empty and can usually stay that way. Add a key
only to retune one target or to enable something no group covers; values resolve as
**entry → group → Defaults**, so a per-prefab setting always beats its group:

```yaml
Locations:
  Eikthyrnir:
    ResetHours: 12        # BossAltars still enables it; this just retimes it
```

For the full list of names your world can reset — including everything other mods add — run
`sls-loc-dump`. It writes `SavedData/LocationResetCatalog.yaml` as a reference; that file is a
dump, not a config, and editing it does nothing.

**Advanced sections are omitted while unused.** `Throughput`, `InPlaceRefresh`, `ProtectedPrefabs`
and `DistanceBands` are left out of the generated file because their defaults suit almost every
server. Add a section by hand to use one — anything you leave out keeps its default. The config
file's own header comment documents each with its default value.

**Scheduling by clock time.** `ResetHours` measures elapsed time since a target last reset, so a
24h timer drifts a little later every cycle and you cannot say "restock overnight". `ResetSchedule`
takes a cron expression instead, usable anywhere `ResetHours` is:

```yaml
ResetGroups:
  Ores:
    ResetSchedule: 0 3 * * *        # 03:00 every day
  Foraging:
    ResetSchedule: '*/30 * * * *'   # every 30 minutes
  AshlandsForts:
    ResetSchedule: 0 4 * * MON      # 04:00 on Mondays
```

Fields are `minute hour day-of-month month day-of-week`, supporting `*`, `,`, `-` and `*/n`.
Day-of-week is `0-6` (0 = Sunday) or `SUN`–`SAT`, months are `1-12` or `JAN`–`DEC`, and the macros
`@hourly`, `@daily`, `@midnight`, `@weekly`, `@monthly` and `@yearly` all work. Quote any expression
starting with `*`, or YAML will read it as an alias.

Times are the **server's local time**, not UTC and not in-game time. Two things to know:

- If **both** day-of-month and day-of-week are restricted, a day matching *either* fires —
  `0 0 1 * MON` is the 1st of the month **and** every Monday. Surprising, but it is what every cron
  does.
- `BiomeRates` and `DistanceBands` do **not** scale a cron schedule; there is no sensible way to
  halve "every Tuesday at 3am". A rate of `0` still excludes the chunk entirely.

The two fields resolve as one unit, entry → group → Defaults: the first level that sets *either* one
owns the timing, so a per-prefab `ResetHours` still overrides its group's `ResetSchedule`. An invalid
expression is logged and that target quietly falls back to `ResetHours` rather than taking the config
file down.

**Focusing resets where they are needed.** Depletion is not uniform — it concentrates in the
biomes and near the spawn areas your players actually work. Two multipliers stack on top of each
entry's own `ResetHours`, so `effective hours = ResetHours × biome rate × band rate`, and both
default to `1.0`:

```yaml
BiomeRates:
  Meadows: 0.5          # everything in the Meadows returns twice as fast
  Mistlands: 2.0        # ...and half as fast out in the Mistlands
DistanceBands:
- Inner: 0              # metres from spawn
  Outer: 3000
  Multiplier: 0.5       # the hub recovers twice as fast
```

A rate of `0` **excludes** that biome or band from resets entirely — it does not mean "instantly" —
which is also the cheap way to say "only reset near spawn". `Outer: 0` means no outer limit, and a
chunk matching no band is left at `1.0`, so a partial band list never disables the rest of the
world. Distance is measured from the same point as the distance level-scaling rings; see
`DistanceBonusIsFromStarterTemple`.

**Ignoring trivial player clutter.** One abandoned campfire otherwise freezes a chunk forever: any
player-built piece blocks a reset, and the protection scan covers a chunk *and its 8 neighbours*.
Worse, a campfire sitting on an ore spawn stops that node coming back even when the chunk does
reset, because vanilla will not place vegetation into a collider. Each protection category can list
prefabs exempt from it:

```yaml
Protection:
  PlayerBuiltPiece:
    Action: Block
    Ignored:
    - fire_pit
```

> An ignored prefab neither blocks a reset **nor survives one — it is deleted.** `fire_pit` ships
> ignored for the reasons above; add to the list sparingly. Tombstones can never be ignored, and
> anything in `ProtectedPrefabs` wins over an ignore. Every deletion is recorded in the chunk log.

**Resetting terrain around a location.** Players dig approach ramps and moats just *outside* a
dungeon's footprint, where the normal terrain reset does not reach. `ExtraTerrainRadius` on a
location entry adds metres beyond the location's own radius (clamped to 64m, which is as far as the
protection scan actually checks for player property):

```yaml
Locations:
  Crypt2:
    Enabled: true
    ResetTerrain: true
    ExtraTerrainRadius: 24
```

**Seeing what it did.** Every chunk the system works on gets a record in
`SavedData/LocationResetLog.log` — its zone coordinates, world position and biome, and what was and
was not reset inside it, including the reason anything was skipped:

```
Zone -12,34 @ x=-768 z=2176 (BlackForest) reset: refreshed pickables 14, minerock 3 | location 'Crypt2' rebuilt (cleared 214, spawned 218) | ZDO 402->405
Zone -12,35 @ x=-768 z=2240 (Meadows) skipped: protected by PlayerBuiltPiece 'wood_floor' at x=-742 z=2251
Zone -12,36 @ x=-768 z=2304 (Meadows) nothing reset: location 'FireHole' not due, 3 vegetation entries not due
```

Turn this off with `EnableLocationResetLog`. `EnableDebugLocationResetDetails` additionally copies
the background sweep's chunk lines into the BepInEx log and expands every record with a per-entry
breakdown of what was skipped and why. Both are client-side settings, so on a dedicated server they
are configured on the server itself.

Not compatible with VentureValheim's LocationReset — SLS disables its own Location Reset
automatically if that mod is present, since both would fight over the same objects.

### Localization
Localization is available for everything in the mod. I accept community translations! If you would like to contribute localizations or improve them please reach out on discord.

Otherwise localizations are available at `Bepinex/config/StarLevelSystems/localizations`, new languages can be made using any of [Jotunns language specific names](https://valheim-modding.github.io/Jotunn/data/localization/language-list.html)

### Terminal Commands
Star Level Systems provides a number of terminal commands for debugging, testing and cleanup. Type
`sls-help` in the console for the full list, or `sls-help loc` for a single group. Tab-completes each
argument as you type it, and colours output by severity (turn that off with the `EnableTerminalColors`
client setting if you prefer plain text).

- `sls-help [area]` - lists the StarLevelSystem commands, optionally just one area
- `sls-creature-killall [range:500]` - kills creatures within the specified range (default 500m), skips players and tamed creatures
- `sls-creature-setlevel [level] [range:64]` - sets the closest creature (within the search range) to the given level. Level 1 is no stars, 2 is one star, and so on; clamped to that creature's configured maximum
- `sls-mod-give [modifier_type:major] [modifier_name:fire]` - gives nearby creatures the specified modifier (must be very close)
- `sls-loot-dump` - dumps all loot table configurations in the game, in SLS format, to `Bepinex/config/StarLevelSystems/LootTablesDump.yaml`
- `sls-zone-rebuild` - regenerates the zone map from the world and redraws the minimap overlay. Resets zone kill counts and levels
- `sls-nemesis-spawn [biome]` - force-scouts and places one remote Nemesis boss
- `sls-nemesis-score [value]` - sets your local Nemesis score
- `sls-raid-spawn [raid_name] [x] [z]` - force-starts a raid, ignoring every cooldown and activation requirement (biome, keys, player base). Tab-completes the raid names from your `RaidSettings.yaml`. Defaults to your own position; pass an `x` and `z` to start it somewhere else. The raid does not consume the target player's raid cooldown, so it will not delay their next natural raid. Works on raids that are disabled or while `DisableAllRaids` is set, so you can test one before turning it on

Location Reset commands (server authoritative):
- `sls-loc-status` - reports sweep throughput, how much of the world has been examined, the projected time for a full pass, and cumulative ZDO drift
- `sls-loc-dump` - writes every location and vegetation entry this world knows about (including ones other mods add) to `SavedData/LocationResetCatalog.yaml`, for use when configuring `LocationResetSettings.yaml`
- `sls-loc-stamp` - stamps every generated zone as reset right now. Run this once after installing on an existing world
- `sls-loc-reset [range:64]` - immediately resets the chunks around you, ignoring every timer, including the chunks currently loaded around you. Reports each chunk it touched to the console. Player structures are still protected
- `sls-loc-audit [range:256] [fix]` - scans for duplicate world objects and surplus terrain compilers. Reports only unless `fix` is passed

#### Running the server commands from a client

The Location Reset commands, `sls-nemesis-spawn` and `sls-raid-spawn` act on world state only the server owns. A
dedicated server has no console of its own, so an **admin** can now run them from a connected client:
the request goes to the server, the server runs it, and its output is streamed back into your console
as well as being written to the server's log. `sls-loc-reset` and `sls-loc-audit` centre on **your**
position, which is what makes them usable on a headless server at all.

Non-admins are refused. Several of these are flagged as cheat commands, which vanilla only allows once
`devcommands` is active — on a server that requires
[Server devcommands](https://github.com/JereKuusela/valheim-dev) on the client. `sls-loc-status` is not
a cheat command and works without it.

#### Renamed commands

Commands were regrouped as `sls-<area>-<verb>` in 1.5.2. Every old name still works and is accepted
silently, so existing macros and guides are unaffected; `sls-help` lists the old name alongside each
command.

| Old name | New name |
| --- | --- |
| `SLS-killall` | `sls-creature-killall` |
| `SLS-give-modifier` | `sls-mod-give` |
| `SLS-Dump-LootTables` | `sls-loot-dump` |
| `SLS-rebuild-zones` | `sls-zone-rebuild` |
| `SLS-spawn-nemesis-remote` | `sls-nemesis-spawn` |
| `SLS-SetNem-Score` | `sls-nemesis-score` |
| `SLS-reset-player-modifiers` | `sls-player-reset` |
| `sls-loc-status` | `sls-loc-status` |
| `sls-loc-reset` | `sls-loc-reset` |
| `sls-loc-audit` | `sls-loc-audit` |
| `sls-loc-dump` | `sls-loc-dump` |
| `sls-loc-stamp` | `sls-loc-stamp` |

### API Usage (WIP)
Star Level Systems provides a public API for other mods to interact with.
The API currently allows reading, modifying and managing creature stat modifiers, color, and level.
Check out the API Documentation [here](https://github.com/MidnightsFX/Valheim_Star_Levels_Expanded/tree/master/StarLevelSystem/API)

## Installation (manual)
Modded Valheim requires Bepinex to load mods. If you have not modded before or are trying to simplify how easy it is for you to mod the game I recommend taking a look at a mod manager.
[Gale](https://thunderstore.io/c/valheim/p/Kesomannen/GaleModManager/) is an excellent mod manager. Download it manually, install and start it up.

If you are proceeding manually you will need to ensure that you have installed [Bepinex from the Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/c/valheim/p/denikson/BepInExPack_Valheim/), it has required configuration.

Once you are ready to install mods, they must be unzipped first and go into the `Bepinex/plugins` folder.

- Download and install [Yaml.net](https://thunderstore.io/c/valheim/p/ValheimModding/YamlDotNet/) and [Jotunn](https://thunderstore.io/c/valheim/p/ValheimModding/Jotunn/)
- Download this mod and install it!

## Compatibility
- This mod is incompatible with Creature Level and Loot Control (they do the same things)
- SLS Location Reset is automatically disabled if VentureValheim's LocationReset is installed, since both reset the same objects on their own timers. The rest of Star Level System works normally
- Upgrade World can be used alongside SLS, but avoid running its `locations_reset` / `vegetation_reset` commands against zones SLS Location Reset manages

Compatibility is being worked on for the following mods:
- CarryMeMaster
- PortablePals
