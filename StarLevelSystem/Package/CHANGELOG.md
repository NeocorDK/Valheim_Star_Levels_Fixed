**1.11.0**
 ---
 ```
- Fixed the in-game config panel leaking keystrokes into the game - typing a number in any field used to walk your character around and fire hotkeys
- Escape now closes the config panel, and it has a close button. Previously Escape opened the pause menu on top of it and Cancel was the only way out
- Opening the panel and pressing Apply & Save no longer rewrites the level curve. It used to invent a level generator and overwrite the hand-authored DefaultCreatureLevelUpChance, making level 8 creatures ~7x more common and level 10 ~13x, with no way back. The generator is now a toggle you opt into
- Fixed the Gaussian curve style ignoring its level-up chance. A configured chance of 0 still levelled up 96% of creatures; the slider was really driving the width of the bell. Width moved to a new GaussianSpread field
- Fixed the Table curve style collapsing every creature to a single level when no weight table matched the generator's span - which was every span the panel's sliders produced. It now falls back to the Exponential curve and logs what to add
- The level generator rows now show what the curve actually produces, and warn when a Table shape is missing
- A remote admin's config changes are no longer discarded in silence. Level, modifier, raid and nemesis edits are sent to the server for validation, and the panel reports the verdict instead of closing as though it had saved
- Saving now validates everything before writing anything, so a rejected file no longer leaves half the settings applied
- Fixed the conditional (defeated-boss) level tiers being unreachable. The shipped Meadows tier runs 6..30 while the biome caps at 4, so every Meadows creature came out at exactly level 6. A conditional generator now replaces the biome's level bounds as well as its curve, as documented
- Conditional tiers now update when a boss is defeated. On a dedicated server they never did, for the lifetime of the process
- The 'All' biome fallback inside a conditional block now works
- Fixed zone scaling being inverted: any ZoneLevelBonusPerLevel below 1 made creatures in a levelled zone weaker instead of stronger
- Fixed tame breeding - a level 2 parent could only produce level 1 children, randomized levels did not survive a relog, and breeding after any config reload threw
- Fixed the level cap being applied inconsistently, which rebuilt creatures sitting legitimately at their cap on every config change
- Fixed a crash on a Colorization.yaml that omits DefaultLevelColorization, which then ran the whole session with no colour table
- A server whose config file fails to parse no longer sends that broken file to joining clients, which silently fell back to their own defaults and disagreed with the server about levels and loot
- RaidSpawnEntry.LevelMin is now honoured - the Hildir raid asked for level 25 skeletons and spawned level 1 ones
- A misspelled Faction in RaidSettings.yaml no longer produces raid creatures on the player's own side that cannot attack or be hit
- Zone kill counts no longer include players, tames, training dummies, or the same kill counted once per peer
- Eighteen settings silently inherited a 0-150 range and now carry ranges that match what they mean. KillReportFlushIntervalSeconds of 0 turned a background task into a per-frame loop
- Number fields in the config panel now parse correctly on locales that use a comma decimal separator, where typing 1.5 was read as 15
- Settings whose descriptions contradicted the code are corrected, including the health multipliers (flat, not per level - the boss default of 0.3 gives a boss 30% of its vanilla health) and MultiplayerEnemyHealthModifier (damage resistance, not health)
- MaxBossLevel, EnableCreatureScalingPerLevel and the enemy healthbar settings now take effect without a reload
 ```

 BREAKING: two settings that were never read have been renamed now that they work.
 `EnemyHealthPerWorldLevel` is now `EnemyHealthMultiplierPerWorldLevel` (default 2, matching vanilla),
 and `MiniMapRingGeneratorUpdatesPerFrame` is now `MinimapRingPointsPerFrame` (default 3000). The old
 keys are ignored and can be deleted from your .cfg.

**1.10.2**
 ---
 ```
- Remove cheat flag for SLS commands, admin is still required.
 ```

**1.10.1**
 ---
 ```
- Remove yaml.net outside check
 ```

**1.10.0**
 ---
 ```
- Deep North Update!
 ```

**1.9.1**
 ---
 ```
- The server's raid check schedule is now saved with the world, instead of restarting on every login
- New Raids option RaidCooldownClock chooses what raid cooldowns are measured against
	- PlayerTime counts only time that player has spent in the world
	- WorldTime (default) counts time the world is played by anyone, matching previous behaviour
 ```

**1.9.0**
 ---
 ```
- Improves performance for mass deletion of creatures or other objects
- Fixed tree and bird level scaling stripping drop weights, so multi-item drop tables only ever dropped their first entry - Beech gave Resin but no Feathers or Seeds, Scorched Trees gave Blackwood but no Charcoal
- Retuned tree drops
	- Its default rises from 0.2 to 0.5 so per-level yields stay close to before.
 ```

**1.8.0**
 ---
 ```
- Fixed Location Reset stripping pieces out of structures it had just rebuilt
- Fixed zone levels and kill counts resetting every time a world loaded
- New ZoneScaling option ZoneDecayClock chooses what zone decay measures against
	- GameTime counts only time the world is actually being played
	- RealTime (default) counts real world time, so time between play sessions can reduce zone heat
- Improves performance for some rare raid and nemesis checks
 ```

**1.7.3**
 ---
 ```
- Location Reset no longer clears everything inside a location's radius, it is now more precise
- Vegetation resets no longer create prefabs world generation never places
	- Dormant entries are now skipped, and each one is named in the log once per world
- Creatures are now linked to the spawner that made them, and the links are rebuilt at world load
	- Covers SpawnArea (greydwarf nests, bone piles, EvilHearts) and TriggerSpawner
	- Linked creatures are removed with their spawner wherever they have wandered
- Chunk log lines now report vegetation preserved, objects cleared, and duplicates dropped
 ```

**1.7.2**
 ---
 ```
 - Fixes Exponential loot giving vanilla amounts for creatures with vanilla drop tables (the multiplier collapsed to 1x)
 - Exponential now scales as (1 + PerLevelLootScale)^(level-1) everywhere, so a 0-star creature is exactly 1x and the defaults match vanilla's doubling
 - Reworks ChancePerLevel, amounts now scale linearly like PerLevel, with only a chance to drop at all
	- PerLevelLootChanceScale and ChanceBaseChancePerLevel control the chance an item has to drop, impacts all creature drops when enabled
 - Fixes near infinite loot drops failing to spawn
 ```

**1.7.1**
 ---
 ```
	- Fix for being too tired and not including 1.7.0 in the package yesterday
 ```

**1.7.0**
 ---
 ```
- The mod API can now drive Location Resets. See API/README.md
	- Mods can register their own reset targets (a custom dungeon, a modded ore) with an interval or a cron schedule, and they join the normal background sweep
	- Mods can reset a named location, or everything within a radius, and get a result summary back
	- Mods can ask when a location or a map chunk was last reset, and when it is next due
	- Registrations survive a config reload and a world reload, and never get written into your yaml
	- Your LocationResetSettings.yaml always wins: adding a Locations:/Vegetation: key for the same prefab takes manual control. Protection rules cannot be set from the API at all
	- Resets requested through the API default to waiting for players to leave the area; a mod has to opt in to forcing one
- Adds sls-loc-reset-named, which resets a single named location near you - including one no reset group covers
- Adds sls-loc-info, reporting when the chunk you are standing in was last examined, when its location was last reset, and what is blocking it
- Adds sls-loc-api, listing reset targets other mods have registered
- sls-loc-status now lists API-registered targets and whether your config is overriding them
- Only one manual reset can run at a time now, and the background sweep stands down while one does. Two overlapping resets could previously tear down each other's zones
- API/README.md documented a type name that does not exist (StarLevelSystemAPI); the class is StarLevelSystem.API
- The Location Reset API works from a client as well as the server, over a new RPC pair, so a mod whose logic runs client-side (an item that renews a dungeon for the player who used it) works without a server-side counterpart
	- Every Location Reset API method is callback-shaped and returns whether the request was dispatched; on the server the callback still runs immediately
	- Client requests are not admin-gated, so the server bounds them: ClientLocationResetMaxRadius, ClientLocationResetMaxDistance and ClientLocationResetCooldownSeconds. Player structures are protected from every route regardless
	- sls-loc-api tags registrations that arrived from a client with the peer they came from
	- A Location Reset API callback always fires exactly once, including when the request is refused. A refusal arrives as a normal result with outcome 'refused', a reason, and a machine-readable refusalCode (too_far, cooldown, no_such_location, already_running, hard_blocked, ...), so a mod can retry, explain or refund from the one place instead of guessing
- Evolving creatures can now gain modifiers as they level up: EvolvingCanRollNewModifiers (off by default) and EvolvingChanceToRollNewModifier (0.15) in the Modifiers section
	- Each evolution makes one roll; on success the creature gains exactly one new modifier of a single type - Major or Minor (Boss for bosses) - chosen at random from the types that still have room under the creature's modifier limits, honouring LimitCreatureModifiersToCreatureStarLevel against the level just reached. A creature never gains a modifier it already has
- Evolving creatures now apply their new level on the owning client as soon as they evolve
- Improved weighted modifier selection list consistency
 ```

**1.6.2**
 ---
 ```
- Stamina & EitrDrain, nerfed default draining ratios and per level increases 
- BossSummoner fixes:
	- Summoner now does a much better job tracking its spawned list
	- Summoner now prevents overspawning of creatures better
	- Summoner creatures inside a dungeon now spawn their summons in the dungeon, instead of on the surface below it
- Location reset fixes:
	- A rebuilt dungeon now re-seals its keyed entrance
	- A location that was not rebuilt now says why in the chunk log
 ```

**1.6.1**
 ---
 ```
- Adds options to ignore player built prefabs on a group-by-group basis for resets
	- This allows forcing resets on high value locations, such as dungeons/ores (it still skips for players present and wards)
- Adds a new config option OverLevelTamesGetRerolledOnLoad which defaults to false. This controls if tamed creatures which are over a biome or global max level limit get rerolled
- Adds a new command sls-creature-setlevel, which sets the closest creatures level
 ```

**1.6.0**
 ---
 ```
- Modifies the quick configuration system to add support for more mods
- Every yaml config file now contains full documentation in-file
- New command `sls-raid-spawn [raid_name] [x] [z]` force-starts a specific raid
- Creature modifier fixes:
	- LifeLink now uses a per-creature cooldown
	- Summoner bosses now work for every summoner
	- PoisonNova and FireNova can fire from the same creature
	- ElementalChaos can now also roll Poison
	- Splitter spawns are capped and spread across frames instead of instantiating every split synchronously in the death frame
	- Modifiers added via the console command or the API now actually apply their stat changes
- Level and loot fixes:
	- PerLevelTreeLootScale sub-logs use their spawn point's rotation as vanilla does
	- SpawnMultiplicationAppliesToTames was inverted
	- Distance level bonuses now use the starter temple as their center on dedicated-server clients even with map rings disabled
	- The over-level correction now uses the same biome-aware max level as the roll gate
- Raid fixes:
	- A raid wave with an invalid prefab name now logs and skips it
	- Fixed a startup error when no saved raid registry exists yet
	- Raid and nemesis spawns are now woken on spawn, and stay awake
	- Raid creatures now actually hunt the player more reliably
- Nemesis fixes:
	- Nemesis map pins are cleared on logout so they can't leak into the next world
	- Fixed a player-death score update that could throw before any score data existed, and minibosses defined without minions no longer throw when spawning
- Config fixes:
	- World state files (location reset stamps, zone data, raid registry, Nemesis remote state) are now stored per-world; switching worlds previously overwrote one world's state with another's. Existing files migrate automatically
	- Hand-editing the main cfg from the main menu is now picked up
- PAPI Changes:
	- AddNewModifierToSLS now wired up
- Performance improvements:
	- Creature, tree and HUD caches are now evicted more reliably
	- The per-hit damage modifier path no longer builds its debug report unless the damage debug flag is on
	- The enemy HUD no longer allocates unless names/modifiers have changed
	- Hover names for SLS-renamed creatures are localized once
	- Size updates skip the global physics sync when the scale is unchanged
	- Nearby-creature queries use the game's character registry instead of an unfiltered physics sphere
	- Attack damage factors read the creature cache
	- Terrain resets batch all craters in a chunk
 ```

**1.5.4**
 ---
 ```
- Fixes raids never starting on crossplay (PlayFab) servers
- Fixes a player's private keys not being set when the player was dead or respawning
 ```

**1.5.3**
 ---
 ```
- Improves resiliance of per-player data synchronization for individual raids
 ```

**1.5.2**
 ---
 ```
 - Admins can now run the server-authoritative commands (all sls-loc-* plus sls-nemesis-spawn) from a connected client
	- Non-admins are refused, and the server re-checks the sender on every request rather than trusting the client
	- Tab-completion now works on every argument, and offers values that depend on the earlier arguments - sls-mod-give completes the modifier type, then only the modifiers belonging to that type
	- Output is coloured by severity. Turn it off with the EnableTerminalColors client setting. The BepInEx log and the Location Reset chunk log are always plain text
	- Adds sls-help, which lists the SLS commands grouped by area with their old names
 - Renamed commands to a consistent sls-<area>-<verb> scheme. Every old name still works, so existing macros and guides are unaffected
	- SLS-loc-reset-status/here/audit/dump/stamp-all -> sls-loc-status/reset/audit/dump/stamp
	- SLS-killall -> sls-creature-killall, SLS-give-modifier -> sls-mod-give, SLS-Dump-LootTables -> sls-loot-dump
	- SLS-rebuild-zones -> sls-zone-rebuild, SLS-spawn-nemesis-remote -> sls-nemesis-spawn, SLS-SetNem-Score -> sls-nemesis-score
	- SLS-reset-player-modifiers -> sls-player-reset (note this command is still only for debugging really, players can't have modifiers... right now)
 ```

**1.5.1**
 ---
 ```
 - Improves ZDO growth tracking for vegetation
 - EnableDebugLocationResetDetails now breaks down the details of any chunk that ends a reset with more ZDOs than it started with
	- If you see repeatedly that a chunk is ending with more ZDOs than it started with, please report it to the mod author with the details of the chunk and the server's configuration
 - Improves dungeon reset to ensure creature removal
 ```

**1.5.0**
 ---
 ```
 - Adds the Location Reset system! Restores looted overworld locations, dungeons, ores, pickables and vegetation so they can be gathered again. Built for large servers where many players compete for a finite pool of resources. Disabled by default (EnableLocationReset), and every location/vegetation entry is opt-in
	- Resets run server-side in the background, and ONLY in zones with no players nearby, so players never see a reset happen
- Adds full safety fallback for empty configs. If a config is empty it will automatically revert to the default configuration. 
- Fixes UseVanillaRaidConfiguration not producing vanilla raids for clients whose config sync failed to arrive. SLS raid names deliberately match the vanilla event names, so a client that never received the server's setting would intercept every vanilla raid the server broadcast, hide it (no banner, minimap circle, music or weather) and start a fresh SLS raid on each 2 second re-broadcast instead. The vanilla raid pipeline is server-authoritative, so clients now always defer to the server for it and a missed sync no longer changes what a client does
	- The raid config is server authoritative: on a server the server's UseVanillaRaidConfiguration and RaidSettings.yaml are synced to clients, so editing them client-side does nothing. This is now noted in the config description and the README
- Fixes vanilla raid weather never applying again after the first SLS raid. Raids released the environment override by forcing "Clear" rather than clearing it, which left a permanent override in place that outranked biome weather and vanilla raid weather. Raids now hand the override back, and only if another system has not taken it over since
- Fixes GlobalRaidIntervalScalar compounding
- Switching UseVanillaRaidConfiguration on mid-session now tears down any running SLS raid instead of stranding its creatures, map pins, music and forced weather permanently
```

**1.4.2**
 ---
 ```
 - Updates the required Jotunn version
 ```

**1.4.1**
 ---
 ```
 - Addresses a network delay that could cause a creature to not gain its modifier name even after gaining the modifier
 ```

**1.4.0**
 ---
 ```
 - Adds support for negative SizePerLevel, so creatures can be configured to shrink with each star
 	- Adds MinimumCreatureScale config (default 0.1), the floor a creature can shrink to. Prevents zero sized or inside-out creatures
	- PerLevelScaleBonus now accepts negative values (range is -0.5 to 2)
	- Fixes changed size settings not applying to already spawned creatures until they respawned
 - Fixes creatures at exactly the max level re-rolling their level
 - Fixes bosses between MaxLevel and MaxBossLevel being treated as over-levelled and constantly re-rolled
 - Fixes ragdolls of creatures whose prefab is not unit-scaled (lox, troll) being sized incorrectly
 - Improved HUD performance slightly
 - Improves cache eviction of HUDs slightly
 - Improves drainer effects to be modified based on how you handle the attack
	- Dodging a drainer attack will prevent the full drain effect
	- Blocking a drain attack will prevent a small amount of the effect
	- Parrying a drain attack will prevent a moderate amount of the effect
 ```

**1.3.0**
 ---
 ```
 - Adds ChancePerLevel as a loot style, which gives each drop a chance to happen that scales on the creatures level (drops amounts scale linearly)
 - Pickables are now fully supported for custom loot drops via nonCharacterSpecificLoot in LootSettings.yaml, keyed by pickable prefab name (e.g. Pickable_Turnip)
 - Improves Lootdebug logging to show more details of how loot is calculated
 - Adds ChancePerLevel as a selectable LootDropCalculationType: each drop becomes an all-or-nothing lottery whose chance grows with level (base amount or nothing), applied to creature, tree, rock, pickable and destructible loot
 - Adds PerLevelLootChanceScale config (default 0.05): under the PerLevel loot style, increases the chance a sub-100% drop occurs by this amount per level, on top of any per-drop ChanceScaleFactor
 - Improves accuracy of distance loot scaling
 - Fixes incorrect logging of tamed loot drop skips
 - EnableDistanceLootModifier Bepinex config (along with enableDistanceLootModifier in Lootsettings.yaml) now both control distance scaling fully
 - Fixes LootDropCalculationType not being applied on load (Exponential scaling was ignored until the setting was changed)
 - Improves minimap redraw conditions
 ```

**1.2.2**
 ---
 ```
 - Trims Nemesis score data to prevent unbounded history
 ```

**1.2.1**
 ---
 ```

	- Custom names, custom loot tables, modify boss stats
 ```

**1.1.3**
 ---
 ```

 - Adds configuration options to control all Boss HUD positioning
	- Configure space to top of screen
	- Configure vertical stacking or horizontal stacking
	- Configure buffer space between boss entries
 ```

**1.1.0**
 ---
 ```
 - Fixes multi-fracture rocks not spawning drops at the broken position (was always falling back to rock center)
 - Raids now wind down gracefully: when a raid ends its creatures stop hunting and wander off to despawn instead of being deleted instantly
	- New config RaidWindDownSeconds (default 60) sets how long creatures linger before the backstop runs
	- New config RaidForceDeleteStragglers (default on) force-deletes any creatures still present at the end of the window; disable to let them all despawn on their own
 - Zone decay rate is now configurable
	- New config ZoneDecayLevelsPerHour (default 0.25) sets how many zone levels decay per real hour; 0 disables decay, higher values speed it up
	- Default decay slowed (one level every 4 hours, ~12 hours for a level-4 zone) and reduced frequency 
 ```

**1.0.1**
 ---
 ```
 - Fixes monsters scaling in dungeons when not set
 - Adds a configuration to enable the previous health font (UI, UseCustomHealthFont)
 ```

**1.0.0**
 ---
 ```
- Provides a simple configuration GUI
	- Can be turned off through configuration
	- Allows tuning some of the largest system knobs that otherwise require yaml editing
- Levelup chance Generators
	- Similar to color generators, these are simple definitions which allow building out complex or large level curves
	- Define a min, max, style (linear, exponential, gaussian), and chance to configure levelup chances
	- Multiple level generators can be used to provide unique level curves
- Adds boss kill based, scaling
	- As the world's bosses are defeated (global keys), levelup chances for creatures in each biome will change
	- The highest entry is selected, and optionally influences any biomes with custom levelup chances (uses level generators)
- Zone Scaling
	- Zones fill the map, they scale independantly. Regular kills in a zone will cause it to spawn stronger enemies.
	- Zones can be seen through a togglable overlay on the minimap
- Current Zone & Distance level can be optionally shown on the minimap now
- Fixes overlapping multiple boss name/healthbars, they are now stacked vertically at their full native width (spacing configurable via BossHealthbarStackSpacing)
- Fix for rare race condition that could result in players seeing a creatures as a different level with enough latency
- Adds a simple configuration for seperately limiting boss creatures levels
- Adds two missing icons to modifier icon display style
- Fixes a bug which would cause raids to silently fail almost immediately
- Added MultiplayerEnemyMinDamageTaken which caps the damage reduction provided to creatures from multiplayer scaling (default creatures take a minimum of 20% damage)
- Fixes DropThat compatibility so DropThat's item modifiers (durability/quality/custom stacks/EpicLoot/etc.) are applied to creature loot again
	- Note: DropThat item modifiers still do not apply to SLS-handled object loot (rocks/trees/destructibles), which keep SLS's level/distance scaling
- Some spelling fixes :) no promises, my spelling still sucks.
- Performance Optimizations for the Nemesis and Raid systems
```
